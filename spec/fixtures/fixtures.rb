# Seeds - Below write the necessary code to seed the database
# so the tests pass.
#
# 1) Create four users:
#    | name              | age   |
#    -----------------------------
#    | Penelope          |  28   |
#    | Pepe              |  34   |
#    | Pete              |  22   |
#    | Priscilla         |  25   |
#
#   After completing step #1, all the tests in spec/01_user_spec.rb should pass.

# 2) Create three leagues:
#    | name      |     day    |  creator    |
#    ------------------------------------------
#    | Hockey    |  Wednesday |  Pepe       |
#    | Soccer    |  Thursday  |  Penelope   |
#    | Tennis    |  Tuesday   |  Priscilla  |
#

# 3) Now things get more complicated. Create one team with three participants.
#    The participation of a user in a team should be modeled as a Membership.

#    Team Name: "Green Monkeys"
#    League: Hockey
#    Uniform Color: Green
#    Captain: Pepe
#    Members: Pepe, Priscilla, and Penelope


# 4) Again, things get more complicated. Create two more teams with one participant each.
#    The participation of a user in a team should be modeled as a Membership.

#    Team Name: "Silver Snakes"
#    League: Soccer
#    Uniform Color: Silver
#    Captain: Pete
#    Membership: Pete

#    Team Name: "Purple Parrots"
#    League: Soccer
#    Uniform Color: Green
#    Captain: Priscilla
#    Membership: Priscilla
